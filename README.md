# Mexico_illiteracy
I have created this visualization using Mike Bostock's D3 as well as Susie Lu's legend creator for D3.
This visualization takes data from the INEGI website: 
https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/tabulados/interactivos/?pxq=Educacion_Educacion_02_fa5c35ea-9385-41f0-86df-bf2bbfc929e3&idrt=15&opc=t
that, after being downloaded and transformed to a csv using Excel, is used by the .js file to show a map of mexico that denotes the % of illiteracy using a color gradient.
